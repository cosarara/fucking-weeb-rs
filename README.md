Fucking Weeb, in Rust
=====================

What?
-----

See <https://github.com/cosarara97/fucking-weeb>

Why?
---

I wasn't having enough fun with CHICKEN,
first of all because I'm a pretty bad scheme programmer,
but also because I faced a couple bugs it had
(which are solved in the upcoming release, 4.12.0).

Anyway, who doesn't love to rewrite stuff?
The second time you write a program you do it better, and faster.

Rust is neat.

Running
-------

Install rust, cargo, and gtk3, then:

    $ cargo run


Progress
--------

Things I'm missing:

* Drag and drop
* Downloads
* CSS
* Autoplay
* Auto filling in the Add form
* Importing databases from the original format
* Using the XDG directories
* Error dialogs
